# YYY-MM-DD Plate Reader Growth Measurement

## Purpose
This experiment aims to measure the growth rate of the *E. coli* strains of interest in media with XX selection.

## Experimental Protocol

1. Cells as described in "Strain Information" were grown to saturation in 0.5 mL
of LB in a deep 96 well plate.

2. Cells were diluted 1:10,000 into M9 + 0.5% glucose media on a new deep 96
well plate 12 hours before the experiment for cells to be at exponential growth.

3. The cells were then diluted 1:40 into the plate reader 96 well plate with a
total volume of 300 ÂµL.

4. The plate was placed in a Biotek Gen5 plate reader and grown at 37C, shaking
in a linear mode at the fastest speed. Measurements were taken every 7 minutes
for approximately 36 hours.
