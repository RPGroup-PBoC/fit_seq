# 2021-11-23 Plate Reader Growth Measurement

## Purpose
In this experiment I compared the growth curves of wild type *E. coli* in two different kinds of minimal media. One is the typical minimal media we use in lab, which contains only M9 salts, CaCl2, MgSO4 and Glucose. The other media used is minimal media supplement with trace elements and thiamine. The purpose of this experiment is to compare the two medias and see which one might be better for future experiments.

## Experimental Protocol

1. Cells as described in "Strain Information" were grown to saturation in 5 mL
of LB at 37C overnight in an incubator without shaking.

1. Cells were diluted 1:100 in the respective minimal medium and grown until they reached 0.4 OD. Here it needs to be noted that 
cultures in media without supplements reached the final OD sooner, hence the cultures for media with supplements were taken from the shaker at OD 0.35.

2. The cells were then diluted to a final OD of 0.01 into the plate reader 96 well plate with a
total volume of 300 µL.

4. The plate was placed in a Biotek Gen5 plate reader and grown at 37C, shaking
in a linear mode at the fastest speed. Measurements were taken every 20 minutes
for approximately 20 hours.
